Attendance Manangement System Using Face Detection  

This system aims to build an effective class attendance system using face recognition
techniques. The proposed system will be able to mark the attendance via face Id. It will detect
faces via webcam and then recognize the faces. After recognition, it will mark the attendance of
the recognized student and update the attendance record. 

To run this app we must have flask installed.
