Attendance Manangement System Using Face Detection  

This system aims to build an effective class attendance system using face recognition
techniques. The system will detect faces using haarcascade_frontface model available in OpenCV and then recognize the faces using a KNN model. After recognition, it will mark the attendance of the recognized student in a CSV file  

To run this app we must have flask installed.  

Instructions to run:  
`git clone https://github.com/Vismaya2811/UE20CS302-Machine-Learning-Project.git`  

`cd ../UE20CS302-Machine-Learning-Project/`  

`python -m flask run`
